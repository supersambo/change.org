## An R Wrapper for the change.org API
This package provides an interface to the Application Programming Interface of [*change.org*](http://change.org). Its meant to be used for research purposes, thus it only includes data gathering requests.

#### Installation

You can install the **change.org** package from GitHub using the [devtools package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) as follows:

```r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("supersambo/change.org")
```

The API requires a valid api_key which can be requested [here](https://www.change.org/developers/api-key).
